   # Project-1\
   # Text representation with higher-order paths using Linked-Lists.
   * This project aims to represent these higher-order paths by using 
   Linked-Lists. Consequently, this project is a programming assignment in C, which aims to build an algorithm based on linked-lists that      will build an efficient representation of documents.
