# Data Structures
  This repository includes Data Structures projects.
  
   # Project-1
   # Text representation with higher-order paths.
   * This project aims to represent these higher-order paths by using 
   Linked-Lists. Consequently, this project is a programming assignment in C, which aims to build an algorithm based on linked-lists that      will build an efficient representation of documents.
   
   # Project-2
   # Binary Search Tree topologies.
   * This project is a programming assignment in C which aims at developing an algorithm that
     builds a binary search tree (BST) from a given sequence and attemps to find other sequences
     that yield the same BST topology.
     
   # Project-3
   # Priority Queue in a Preemptive Scheduling System via Binomial Heaps.
   * This project aims that using binomial heaps to implement a priority queue in a preemptive scheduling system.  A preemptive scheduling    mechanism, shown in Fig. 1, operates as follows:
